## 📍 Overview

**MINISHELL** is a custom shell implemented in C. Designed as a learning project, it replicates basic Unix shell functionalities including command parsing, execution, piping, and built-in commands. Its modular design and reliance on the standard C library make it an excellent resource for understanding shell internals and process control in Unix-like systems.

---

## 👾 Features

- **Command Parsing:** Interprets and tokenizes user input.
- **Built-In Commands:** Implements essential commands such as `cd`, `echo`, `env`, `export`, `unset`, and `exit`.
- **Piping and Redirection:** Supports piping between commands and input/output redirection.
- **Libft Integration:** Utilizes a custom library (`libft`) for common utility functions.
- **Modular Design:** Clear separation between parsing, execution, and utility functions.
